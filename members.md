# Lead Partners role

Moral persons, such as companies, public or private organisations, have the ability to become Lead Partners. In order to do so, a moral person must submit a written application to the administrative board, which shall consider the application and take a decision on the basis of all the relevant information. 

Lead Partners participate in a dedicated Lead Partner Committee (LPC) which will be an internal source of advice to the benefit of the software developments achieved by the association and/or the association at large.
